# deploygcp

This is the first individual project for Data Analysis at Scale in the Cloud (ECE 590). 

In this project, Cloud Build is set up to automatically deploy the gcloud app once it is triggered by push operation to this repository. Following the instruction here https://noahgift.github.io/cloud-data-analysis-at-scale/topics/paas-continuous-delivery.html, one can set up the gcloud service. 

Further more, I try to host my personal website on gcloud with continuous delivery. I found official instruction here given by google https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/getting-started/hosting-a-static-website. Note that since we are using Python37 as our runtime environment, we need to remove the second and the third line in the example app.yaml file in the tutorial. My homepage can be found here https://deploygcpjan30-266720.appspot.com/.

A video demo of this project can be found here TBA.
